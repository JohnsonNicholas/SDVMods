## 1. General Notes

### 1a. Frost
Frost, defined as when a freeze is left on plants, is a difficult thing to pin down. Some say it's below 2.2C, others below 0C. We define it here as 2.2C by default, and if I ever need to, a *hard* frost is below -3.33C.

This matters because we want to say what the default max chance of frost is in the mod. Without the hazardous events toggle, this does nothing, however.

### 1b. Wilting

Formally called heatwaves, this controls the threshold where plants wilt and require watering again. If hazardous events are toggled, this can kill crops if they are not watered.

By default, we pin this at 33C.
