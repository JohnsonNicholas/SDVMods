# Normal (Default) Climate

This shows off all of the features of Climates. In versions before 2.0 these were the enhanced versions. In an effort to simplify mainteance, this merges into one file. In an effort to make it easier for people to turn off fog, I've restructured the climates.

## 1. Spring

Springs start at 48 F/37 F with about +4.5/-2.3 F variation in temperature for the first week, and rise to about 62.3F/52 F by mid Spring. Variation dies down, to about +2.6/-2.9 F. As the Spring dies down, it rises to 70F/59 F and ends the season about 76 F/64 F, with a variation of +4/-3 F. Lows are more variant, to -5F. 

While the season starts out wet, the chances of rain drop throughout the season. Storms start moving in towards the end as often as rain. Days have a good chance to be windy, with mostly gentle winds. With the season, fogs are somewhat frequent, mostly around the beginning of the season, while evening fogs are infrequent.

Abnormal cold and heat is about 20% likely throughout the season, with more chances of cold in the beginning. Sandstorms are likelier towards the end of the season, but never exceed 5%. Blizzards are 10% possible, but white outs never. 

Rain stays gentle to light, with a few storms moving through, and wind is primarily NW to W, light. Major lightning storms are unlikely

Chances of typhoons are minimal. 

Flower Rain conversion: 30% (highest)
Jumino Weather: Random chance that a sunny day will be jumino instead: 1.5% pre CC completion, 7.5% pre Movie Theatre completion, 15% post both.
