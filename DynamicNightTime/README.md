#Dynamic Night Time
Version: 1.2.7

## Requirements
- SMAPI 2.10.1+
- Stardew Valley 1.3.33+

## This Mod Does:
- Creates a more dynamic night time and sunrise lighting system. Does not alter wakeup time.


## IMPORTANT NOTE

Make sure that if you have problems with other mods that you are running their latest version.  Also, this mod does not alter wake up time. 

NOTE: DNT does some assumption work lighting after sunset is consistent. This also may not match your tick timing if you use time speed mods.
NOTE2: This mod is incomaptible with Deep Woods prior to 1.2-beta.18 / 1.3-beta.15

## Multiplayer Compatibility
This mod is MP compatible, and all clients will need it for it to work.

## Installation Instructions
- Unzip the folder into your Mods/ folder after making sure SMAPI is installed

## Troubleshooting Notes

* This mod dynamically generates your cycle based on latitude, and then clamps it to the nearest 10  hours. This does means that changes that are less than 3 minutes will not be visible. This is largely due to the nature of the 10 minute clock in Stardew Valley.

*This mod uses Harmony, a tool that allows for rewriting of game functions during runtime.

This mod alters three functions in Game1 - isNightOut, GameClock, getStartingToGetDarkTime, getTrulyDarkTime. They will still return the same variables and generally the same intended use.
